I only recently start to be seriously interested in software. I am interested in distributed systems and operating systems. I have started contributing to OSS recently, and hope to do more.

<!-- About this Blog -->

This blog is a __collection of things__ that I am either learning (more likely), or have learnt (less likely).

This blog is about:

- being frustrated at programming

- what I learned from my projects

- best practices

- trying to communicate in a concise way

- rejogging my own memory

- reblogging other smarter, talented people e.g. [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/)

- my own experiences
